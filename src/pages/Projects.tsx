        I did this semester-long project in my Web Development class. This
        website was developed as I learned the concepts covered in class.
        <br />
        I used TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and React for the front end. The front end was deployed on Netlify.com. I used Node.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose for the back end. The back end was deployed on Render.com
      </p>
    </div>
  );
